1. make utils
   This will fetch all the required installers and the ubuntu ISO
2. make configure
   This will get the IP address range to be used for the internal network
   e.g., 10.0.0.0 or 192.168.0.0
3. make openvswitch
   This will install openvswitch on the sandbox machine. It requires access
   to a mirror hosting the PPA repo.	The instructions to create a mirror are
   at https://launchpad.net/~ivoks/+archive/ovs-saucy. The mirror is only
   20MB in size. Fill the webserver's address in Makefile's PROFILE_PPA
   variable.
4. make switch LIBVIRT_INSTALL=yes VIRTMANAGER_INSTALL=yes
   This will setup the internal bridges on the sandbox machine. These
   arguments reinstall libvirt and virtmanager -- this may be required
   if the machine has old versions of these programs.
5. make baadal-transfer-tar
   This will create a ~/.baadal/utils/baadal.tar file, which is to be
   transferred to all the VMs.
6. make nat
   This will create the NAT VM. The NAT VM should be completely installed
   before installing the controller, because the controller's post VM
   installation script requires NAT to be setup.
7. make filer
   This will create the filer VM. Can be tested by mounting x.y.0.4:/baadal/data
   on the sandbox machine. (here x.y=10.0 or 192.168 depending on internal
   network IPs). The data on the filer is stored in /baadal/data.
8. make controller

----- wait for all VMs to get fully installed -----

9. Go to the NAT VM and type
   $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
   $ make openvswitch
   $ make nat-setup

10. Go to controller VM and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make openvswitch
    $ make controller-setup

11. Go to filer VM and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make openvswitch
    $ make filer-setup

---- start creating hosts ----

12. On the sandbox machine, type
    $ make host HOST_ID=id
    Currently, nine MAC addresses have been specified in the script with
    IDs 1-9.

13. Optionally, go to the host VM and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make host-setup
    Actually this should not be required as the host should have been
    preseeded using PXE boot from the controller.
